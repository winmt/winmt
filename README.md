### About Me

I am currently pursuing an integrated Bachelor's and Master's degree in Cyberspace Security at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I used to participate in `CTF` competitions as a `Pwn` player for the `X1cT34m` and `SU` teams. At present, I am focusing on **IoT security, system and software security, and natural language processing (NLP)**.

### Vulnerability Discovery Results

I have previously committed to vulnerability discovery in IoT firmware. During that period of time, I independently discovered hundreds of vulnerabilities in IoT devices, all of which were authorized by `CVE`, `CNVD` or `CNNVD`. Among them, dozens of vulnerabilities have been **publicly acknowledged** by leading international manufacturers. Additionally, I have been inducted into the **Hall of Fame** by both [ASUS](https://www.asus.com/content/asus-product-security-advisory) and [Zyxel](https://www.zyxel.com/global/en/support/security-hall-of-fame).

The following are some of the publicly disclosed vulnerabilities for which I have received acknowledgments.

- **Ruijie Networks** ReyeeOS Unauthorized RCE vulnerability [CVE-2023-34644](https://www.ruijienetworks.com/support/securityBulletins/cybersecurity_bulletins/10001). The vulnerability affects hundreds of device models under categories including routers, switches, wireless access points, and wireless access controllers, potentially allowing **direct control nearly [200,000](https://www.zoomeye.org/searchResult/report?q=ReyeeOS) devices on the public internet**.
